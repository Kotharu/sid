# sid
Android app aimed at helping Dyslexia kids

sid is a friend, trying to help kids with dyslexia. sid helps them by making them practice Upper case alphabets, lowercase alphabets and digits. 
For every alphabet or a number, the inverted images are shown along with the original ones. 
sid reads out the alphabet/number and then asks the kids to chose what they thinks is the correct one. 
Based on their selection sid shows them if it is a correct answer or not. 

 In the end a score is given for each module. This is to motivate the kids to try to score maximum each time & in the process overcome their difficulty in remembering the correct alphabet/numbers. In all sid says "Practice meets Perfection!!!".
